As is clearly reflected in the above pie chart, it takes on the proportions of purposes of students at a certain university using their phones. According to the chart given above, the proportion of students using their phones to study takes a comparatively large share, accounting for 60%. Next comes the statistic of using their phones for fun, which is 21%, followed by the purpose of gaining information, which accounts for 17%, with 2% for other purpose.

What are the invisible reasons behind the phenomenon reflected by the chart? Nowadays, with the rapid development of our society, especially the IT and information industry, cell phones are accessible and they provide us with a more convenient and efficient way to learn the world better. So, college students could benefit a lot from using phones to learn and get information which can broaden their horizon largely. In addition, the proportion is also a reflection of students under pressure and using mobiles, from my perspective, can relieve their pressure to some extent.

To sum up, the proportions of the purpose of students using mobile phones shown by this chart are reasonable. There are certainly many reasons that may be raised to justify it but, from my point of view, it is the accessibility and the convenience of mobile phones that are the essential key factors of this phenomenon.
